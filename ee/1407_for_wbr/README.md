#### Three Functions
1. Read ADC value from pin ADC6/P1.7, convert it into Voltage, max 6.0V
2. Count the frequency inputed into P3.4
3. Measure the phase difference between P3.4 and P3.5


Cooperation with _Yehang Zhu_  
which was a nice experience.

`SCH` and `PCB` are attributed mostly to Zhu, I proposed some PIN exchange so that these functions can be possibly implemented.  
`src` direcotry contains files compilable using Keil uVision, hex file is generated by Keil uVision 4.  
MCU used is STC12C56AD, compatible with 8051.  

All for wbr.. though.. X_x  
All for no reason?  SIGH..
